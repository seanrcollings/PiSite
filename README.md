# Pi Site

A simple website hosted by a Raspberry Pi 3 that:  
  - Polls data from the Pi
  - Hosts My Sterling Scholar Portfolio
  - Hosts a React-based Mastermind game


> After obtaining my Raspberry Pi at the end of the Pi course in my IT, I initially envisioned this as a simple, static
> website for me to mess around with. The task became quite difficult because I wanted to fetch data from the pi and put on 
> the site which can become quite a tedious process when working with static pages. After learning React, I now had the 
> confidence to build the site in a more reactive manner.

### How does it work? 

I used a number of helpful tools to build this site such as: 

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A Javascript library for building user interfaces
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Builds the development enviorment
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - Web Server to host the site

Feel free to download the source code and mess around with it yourself!
