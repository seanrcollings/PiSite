						<h3 className = 'descriptiopn-title' id='bridgerland'>Bridgerland Education</h3>
						<p>Since the beginning of the 2017-18 school year, I have participated in an IT certification course through Bridgerland Technical college. The class&mdash;overseen by Bonnie Campbell at Bridgerland and John Petersen at Ridgeline&mdash;took us through a series of courses related to the IT and computer technology fields. The program is held after school until 4:15 which amounts to five hours a week minimum working on the courses in the program.</p>
						<p>The courses that I&rsquo;ve taken through this program are PC Pro, Networking Pro, Raspberry Pi, Python, Web Essentials, Linux Essentials, and Mac Essentials. Personally, I enjoyed Networking the most. It was the most in depth course on a single topic and helped me learn a lot about how networks function and the complexities of communication between disparate devices. Last year, I completed all the course work that had been prepared in much less time than expected, enabling me to finish at the top of my class.</p>
						<p>The environment enabled me to learn more in a much shorter time than I would have been able to on my own. With the recommendation of my instructors, I also participated in a web development boot camp during the summer. With their help. I obtained the MTA Software Fundamentals Certification and hope to gain several CompTIA certifications before leaving high school.</p>
						<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for the opportunities participating in this program has given me. Before beginning the program, when someone asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, the response would always be the same. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Ideas bounced inside my head about what to do with my life, but none ever grew into anything more than that. I had an interest in computers and technology, much of which grew from an admiration for my brother, but at that time I would never say that it was a field I would go into. However, this program has given me a solid foundation of reasoning and knowledge to start my path towards a career in technology.</p>
						<p>It showed me what I am capable of when I set my mind towards something and fight for it with the utmost passion and interest. I feel more confident in myself and my future than I ever have in the past. I feel truly lucky that I was given the chance to participate in something so life-changing.</p>
						<p>The class also has taught me a lot about people. While most were diligent and willing to do their work, plenty had difficulty remaining focused throughout the majority of the course. The coursework is paced by the individual so one can do really well and excel or do nothing at all. It showed me that I would have to deal with these kinds of people throughout my life and taught me that I didn&rsquo;t want to be one of them. No matter what, I always want to put 100% into what I do.</p>
